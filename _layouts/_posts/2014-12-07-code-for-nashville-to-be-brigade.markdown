Change is slow and frankly confusing, but it's happening, and it's happening right here in Nashville.  A group of civic hackers, concerned citizens, and basically just awesome people have gotten together and are moving 'Code for Nashville' to new heights.

As of December 3rd, 2014 the Nashville Brigade of Code for America, previously considered a "Brigade Network Member", has satisfied all the requirements to become a full-fledged "Official Brigade Chapter".

How has this happened?

First, local Nashvillians resoundingly decided that they wanted to be involved in their community and have gotten together to launch apps such as the [Nashville Flu Shot App] and [NashViva].
Second, volunteers attending the [December 3rd management meeting] managed to fill out the required form.

What does this mean?

It means the Brigade is growing! It means that people are getting involved and volunteering their time and skills in the hopes of building a more transparent government, aiding populations in need, and giving back to the community.
As of today, code for Nashville has 120 registered [meetup members] and has hosted 7 events including a two management meetings and our [monthly hack nights].
With "Official Brigade" status, Code for Nashville will be eligible for financial support from Code for America, allowing the brigade to get bigger and badder.

In keeping with this, the Brigade is stepping up to host a Nashville node of [CodeAcross 2015].  CodeAcross is a Code For America event that celebrates [International Open Data Day], and we need your help!
Join us on [meetup], attend a [hack night], and help bring civic [hacktivism] to Nashville!
