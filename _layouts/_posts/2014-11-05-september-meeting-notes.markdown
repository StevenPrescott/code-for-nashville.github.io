At the Code for Nashville group’s September 17 meeting, the brigade got down to the business of establishing itself as an entity as well as laying the building blocks for its first apps and projects.

After the formal introductions, John Chapin discussed what would be the group’s priorities starting off: shaping the brigades’ own website, developing a flu shot app based off of a similar Chicago brigade model, identifying Metro data sets, and improving the fledgling [Nashploration] app. CfN members then broke out into small groups to tackle the tacks before them.

The website team established a Github for the website work and them began setting up the Jekyll generator to aid in building out the site and blog features. Team members then browsed other brigade sites and started exploring how to create CfN’s own template using Jekyll. The basic discussion of overall style and form for the site began during this session before continuing on remotely on the team’s Github repository.

Flu shot app members spent a large portion of their hack session trying to decipher Google’s experimental Fusion Tables app used by a previous version of a similar app to import data culled from the websites of the major drugstores and elsewhere. The team eventually made progress with the Fusion table before divvying up work to gather data on flu shot providers’ locations, hours, prices, etc., for the app as well as data validation. The team then arranged to keep work moving on the project remotely. (Go [here] to see what the flu shot app looks like to date.)

CfN’s Metro data team, facilitated by Metro Nashville’s Co-Chief Innovation Officer Yiaway Yeh, reviewed a list of datasets identified by Metro employees as those that could be made available publicly and prioritized for release. Yiaway presented a handout of more than 300 datasets from about 25 different Metro departments made available by the city’s Data Geeks, Metro employees who work in close relation to with the city’s data and who meet monthly to discuss them.

The data team would be considering about 300 datasets — about a third of which is already listed on the [Nashville Open Data Portal] — determined by Metro to be in the “public” and “internal” categories; there are another 200 or so datasets classified as “confidential” or “restricted,” which Metro determined could not be made public. Work on identifying the best use of Metro’s data would be ongoing. Some of the datasets could be used to build on to Nashploration in the future. Yiaway pointed to the fact that other cities’ data portals have zero site views as a motivation for Metro Nashville to work with CfN to support and drive interest in its own data.
