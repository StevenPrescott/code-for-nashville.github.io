###Code Across 2015 Principle 2: Making it Easy for Everyone to Participate


The second contribution to our Code Across 2015 series revolves around the concept of participation.  As a volunteer organization, Code for Nashville is fully dependent on community participation.  Without its volunteers and civic partners CfN does not exist, and with the busy lives that we all lead, it is essential that we make it as simple to participate as possible.
  
So how do we do this?

#####1. Get (yourself) organized!

One of the first challenges CfN faced was figuring out how to handle all of our communication channels.  We use services such as meetup, google, facebook, twitter, and github among others.  Even for members, the sheer volume of services we use can be staggering, so for a new member or first timer it is even worse.  It took working through all this confusion to finally get together a document that outlines all of these utilities, and will probably take some more time still to get that document to our website. Making it easy for everyone to participate means that you have to make it easy for yourself to participate as well.

#####2. Think outside of the git repo.

Though Code for America is primarily technology focused, we often have non-technical volunteers show up to hack nights looking for ways to get involved.  The basic idea of the hack night is that people get together to work on projects, but as you may expect, many of the projects we run are heavily geared towards programming.  This can be frustrating to someone without a technical background, and indeed, we have heard anecdotes about people who came to hack nights only to feel like they had nothing to contribute and were thus inadvertantly discouraged from showing up.

The last thing we want to do in a volunteer organization is discourage people from showing up!

So how are we trying to fix this?  We've begun to focus on ways to contribute that don't require programming skills.  In fact, this blog series is an example of just that.  As we continue to develop applications and build deeper relationships within our community, media, PR, and policy people become more and more important.  There are events to plan, blogs to write, and key stakeholders to communicate with.  We want (and need) your help, and are happy to put you to work!

#####3. Code Across 2015 Principle 1: Design with the user in mind, and keep it simple.

I've conveniently managed to wrap this post up with a reference to the [first post] in our Code Across 2015 blog series, but the self-referential thing is justified in this regard: the biggest obstacle to engagement is the level of effort required participate, and in the technology field this is especially true.  The more pieces there are in a machine, the more likely it is to fail.  Design in a way that reduces the burden on the end user - whether it be a web app, a blog, or even an event signup form, there's got to be as little friction as possible if it is going to see widespread adoption.
