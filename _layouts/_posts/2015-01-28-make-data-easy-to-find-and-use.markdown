###Code Across 2015 Principle 3: Make Data Easy To Find And Use
The first question that popped into my mind when I read this principle was 'What's the point of making data accessible if it's not easy to find or use?'. So many great things can be achieved through using data the right way but first we must make sure it is available and understandable. Sure, this may sound simple enough but what may be intuitive to one person can seem like a riddle to another. Those who know the internet and its workings inside and out must remember that to make data useful it must be in an easy-to-read format and easily accessible. 

As someone who only six months ago knew barely anything about the world that is programming, I know what it is like scouring the internet for information only to turn up datasets that could possibly of been relevant if only I knew how to extract the data or even where to look in the first place. Our entire purpose at Code For Nashville is to stop these headaches for people by providing access to metro government datasets. Recently, Code For Nashville released [Nashville Flu Shots](http://www.nashvilleflushots.org/) that displays the locations Nashville residents can get a flu shot. By placing the locations on a map and creating a website this dataset is now available for the community to use. Providing an easy gateway to data can help with government transparency and community cooperation. 

Nashville is well on its way to adopting this principle. [The Nashville Open Data Portal](https://data.nashville.gov/) makes data collected by the Nashville and Davidson Country Departments available to the public. Its website is easy to navigate and it has a range of options for exporting datasets. Datasets range from art grants and historic markers to General Government employees titles and base annual salaries. Code For Nashville is working with the Nashville metro government to prioritize which datasets are released first and in what format. Through the magic of [Socrata](http://www.socrata.com/) the public are able to view the datasets as visual maps, graphs and use filters to manipulate the information.  

As mentioned before, data is useless if it cannot be found or repurposed in a meaningful way. A goal every community should have is to make government data accessible to its least technical citizens and use it in a timely and beneficial way. We all have skills to contribute whether it is creating an app that displays data or voting on which dataset to make public next. 

Data is easy to collect. The hard part is putting it to use.
