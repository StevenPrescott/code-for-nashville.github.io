###Code Across 2015 Principle 3: Focus On What Government Can Do

The next principle on our tour is "Focus on what government can do". This has been a particularly interesting principle to deal with since joining Nashville's Code for America Brigade. We all are extremely motivated and ready to get to work. But what does that look like? How do we prioritize the work? What are our relationships with the government as a newly minted organization?

We are all in the beginning stages of getting together and seeing what this relationship even looks like for Nashville. As we sort things out, having a focus on what government CAN do will help settle some of the noise. Putting our energy into solutions that will ACTUALLY have an impact on our citizens will continue to help drive the energy we are already seeing. Working on projects that dead end or have a limited purpose will be discouraging to the group.

So what problems CAN we come together and solve?!? Well, the [Code for America blog](http://www.codeforamerica.org/governments/principles/#collaborate) references the city of Oakland. The "city officials and a community group collaborated to write answers to the questions that citizens searched for most frequently on the website." That's simple enough! In Boston, they have programs that allow fire hydrants to be adopted (to be cleared of snow or other obstacles).
 
Here in Nashville, we forked one of Chicago's projects to make our [Flu Shot App](http://www.nashvilleflushots.org/). You can use this website to find out where to get the Flu Vaccine! 

Our Hack Nights include individuals with so many ideas. They are civic-minded, volunteer-ran, and community-driven! People's passions range from providing families with enough diapers for their babies to helping the homeless find shelter during inclement weather. One of our most popular topics usually has to do with bus schedules!! Some of these projects are already up and running. Others are just ideas!

So why is "focus on what government can do" so important?
Often the talks begin just by seeing what is already out there then move to "what CAN we do?".
